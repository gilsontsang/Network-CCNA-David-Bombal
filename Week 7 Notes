Switch Stacking
- TLDR: "LOGICAL - SINGLE VIRTUAL SWITCH" 
***TLDR2: Stacking techologies and Chassis Aggregation Technologies... Simplifies management, configuration and forwarding of traffic
- Multiple switches linked together to act as a single switch through 'stacking ports'
- Connected in a series (ring) - 1st switch attaches to last switch
- Full duplex
- Single "STACK MASTER" that controls the stack
- Runs the same protocols, share the same MAC Address table, single management IP Address, one configuration file, (STP, CDP, VTP) running on one switch ONLY
BENEFITS:
1) Etherchannels/Link Aggregation is created - easier/better than STP, STP has to block one port and allow another port
2) Simplified configuration and management of network

Switch Stacking (Access Layer vs Chassis Aggregation)
1) Access Layer
- stack of switches joined together via special cables - up to 8 switches
2) Chassis Aggregation
- Distribution and core layers 
- Does not require special cables, instead uses ethernet interface switches - usually 2 switches
- HA High Availability / Redundancy / Scalability (HSRP Hot Standby Router Protocol, Spanning Tree)
- Cisco VSS Virtual Switch System 
BENEFIT: HA, Redundancy, Scalability
DOWNSIDE: Harder to implement, cost 

Chassis Based Switch (Using Link Aggregation)
- 2 or more switches are independent of each other, but joined together
- Multiple line cards, supervisor modules and power supplies
*Supervisor Module: If one of the modules go down, the supervisor module can take over the management of the switch

Aggregated Chassis Environment
- Similar to Chassis Based Switch, but the multiple switches becomes one switch
BENEFITS: STP not required because if switches are setup R1(2 switches in 1) + R2(4 switches in 1) but R1 and R2 are single switches, then there is only 1 link between R1 and R2

ACL Access Control List
- Used to permit/deny packets moving through a router
- If packet match ACL, then permit or if deny packet, then deny. Otherwise if no match, it will be denied

Standard ACL
- Permits or Denies based on source IP Address

Extemded ACL
- Permits or Denies based on source IP Address, destination IP Address, protocols, applications, ports, etc...

Inbound ACL:
- ACL determines whether to allow/deny traffic before it hits router
1) ACL -> 2) Router
Outbound ACL:
1) Router -> 2) ACL
**It is more efficient to bind an ACL for inbound traffic
