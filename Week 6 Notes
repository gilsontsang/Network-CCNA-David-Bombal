2 types of Network Management Protocols
*****USE BOTH*****
> NMS Network Management System
1) Query-Based Network Management Protocol
**NMS sends a query to extract information, then waits for response
[Advantage] Reliable - query and waits for return message
[Disadvantage] Slow to react = Could be queried/poll every 5 minutes, therefore it could take 5 minutes for action
- If NMS queries and does not get a response -> problem
- a.k.a Polling based Network Management - can be scheduled and frequency
2) Event-based
**NMS listens for possible announcements/events
- Syslog, SNMP trap based
[Disadvantage] Not reliable - passively waiting, event errors might not arrive
[Advantage] Acts quickly = Immediate, once event has taken place (SNMP trap)
*****USE BOTH*****

Network Availability
- 5 9s -> 99.999% ~ 5 minutes of downtime a year
- 4 9s -> 99.99% ~ 52 minutes of downtime a year

Collect Data remotely
- Distributed NMP Network Management Architecture vs Single Centralized NMS
~ Multiple Data Centres and Multiple Copies of NPM forwards to EOC Enterprise Operation Console

Network Reachability
- SNMP & ICMP (important to NMP Network Management protocol) may be blocked by Network Engineers - reliability issue 
> Bypass this by allowing certain subnets through
> Bypass this by allowing Management VLAN with ACL and Firewall rules disabled

NMP Network Management Protocol
[SolarWinds]  
Fault Management -> uses ICMP/ping. If no ping response, then NMS assumes device is down
[Orion]
Fault Management -> If no ping response, placed in 'Mode Warning Stage', then Orion will 'fast poll of device' will monitor the device for 120s before Orion notifies you device is down

NMS vs SNMP
NMS (ICMP/Ping): no ping response, assumes device is down
SNMP: queries the device, if SNMP says it is down, then NMS can confirm it is down

ICMP/Ping vs SNMP vs WMI Windows Management Instrumentation
ICMP/ping - availiability calculations, latency response timers
SNMP - everything else
WMI - checks for performance counter type values

*When NMS sends Data along with its Ping request because the device's Firewall being pinged might block:
- 0 size Data field
- large payload
- odd in size

SNMP 
- UDP (port 161)
