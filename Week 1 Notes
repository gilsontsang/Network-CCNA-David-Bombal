Network Protocol
- Language that governs communication between networking devices

Cost of route
- The number of routes (jumps) it takes to go from one interface to another

SOHO 
- Small office & Home office

tracert 
- tracert is amount of hops to destination

Logical topology
- Path of how data is transferred between devices

Physical topology
- Physical arrangement of a network (cables, devices)

DNS Domain Name System

Speed (bits per second)
(bytes = 8 bits)

Uptime vs Availability
- Uptime = Number of minutes / Total number of minutes in a year [525600]
- Availability = ((Total number of minutes in a year-Downtime in minutes)/(Total number of minutes in a year ))* 100

Bus topology
- All devices connected in a line that branches off

Ring topology
- Cabled together, first device connected to last device
- Each device connected to 2 device

Star topology
- Star shape, all devices connected to a central switch

Mesh topology
- One device connects to multiple devices -> increase redundency

OSI Model (Open System Interconnect Model) - created by International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
Please do not throw sausage pizza away
- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Datalink
- Physical
*Each layer is independent of each other

Layer 7 Application Layer
- FTP, Telnet, HTTP
- Use protocols to communicate with lower layers
- Provides network services to application, user authentication
- Not talking about individual application
- Talking about application protocol, not the application itself

Layer 6 Presentation Layer
- Ensures that data sent by one application is "readable" by another application (MP3 can be listened to online with Windows and iOS because data is presented in a format that both side understands)
- Formats data to be presented to application layer
- Negotiates data transfer syntax for application layer
- Provides encryption
- This data must be changed to "Machine independent format"
~ Imagine opening a JPG in Notepad

Layer 5 Session Layer
- Establish, maintain and terminate of sessions between applications
- Two application processes on different machines can establish session
ex. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)
ex. PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)

Layer 4 Transport Layer
- Message segmentation: segment the message in the upper layers into smaller units, then passes it down to Network layer for sending
- Handles transportation issues between hosts
- Ensures data transport reliability
- Flow control, makes sure it is not transferring more data than it can process
- Sessoin Multiplexing, multiple messages streams or sessions onto one logical link 
1) TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 
	- reliability, maintains, and terminates virtual circuits
	- TCP 3-way handshake
	- If paket is missing, it will be retransmitted
2) UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - 
	- Does not provide reliability
	- If packets dropped, they are lost, does not retransmit lost packet

Layer 3 Network layer
- This layer is all about Data Delivery, how it routes data from one device to another 
- Concern with path determination
- 3 routing protocols in Layer 3 switches (router capable)
1) OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
2) BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
3) IS-IS (Intermediate Systems to Intermediate Systems)
*No reliability at this level. Must depend on TCP. If UDP is used, application layer need to provide reliability. Ex. TFTP uses UDP at Layer 4, and IP at Layer 3 = no reliability. Therefore, TFTP must provide reliability

Layer 2 Data Link
- Concerns with how data is formatted for transmission 
ex. Ethernet -> use MAC address XXXYYY = 48bits (made from OUI Organization Unique Identifier XXX + Unique Portion YYY)
- MAC Address is flat address structure VS IP Address is logically assigned. Therefore, Data Link does 
- Provides error detection
- Data link formats according to the type of Media (Ethernet, WAN link) into the appropriate Physical Link 

Layer 1 Physical
- Physical Device and Physical Cabling
- Specs of these media types

TCP/IP model
- Application Layer
- Transport Layer
- Internet Layer
- Network Access Layer

Host Communication:
- Layer 7 only talks to Layer 7 through encapsulation and decapsulation, similarly 1 -> 1 
- Encapsulation puts "header" onto the user data from L7 to L2, then FCS Frame Check Sequence occurs at the end to ensure there is no corruption

Hexadecimal (0-F)
0,1,2,...,9,A,B,...,F
0,1,2,...,9,10 (1010),11,...,15 (1111)
ex. 128 = 1000 0000 = 8 0 or 80 (Hexadecimal)
ex. 240 = 1111 0000 = 15 0 or F0 (Hexadecimal)

ipconfig /all | more
arp -a
telnet (ip)

Change MAC address of computer (NIC -> Configure -> Network Address)

*Ping requires ICMP Internet Control Message Protocol

RFC1918 Addresses
- Private address 10.1.1.1

IP Characteristics
- Layer 3 or network layer protocol
- Connectionless, no sessions formed. TCP on the other hand is connection oriented
- packets treated independently of other packets (packets can take different paths to get to destination)
	-> these packets go through "Routing Protocol" where it determines the bestpath from A to B (bandwidth, hopcount, load balancing)
- NO guranteed delivery or data loss recovery (corruption), IP uses "best effort delivery", again TCP will be needed if guranteed is requried

Recap IP:
- no builtin sessions
- no builtin retransmission
- TCP is needed to handle dropped, corrupted, and misdirected packets. IP relies on higher level protocol for those requriements

Before TCP can be established and any data transmitted, 3-way handshake
(Transmitter) SYN -> (Receiver)
(Transmitter) <- SYN ACK (Receiver)
(Transmitter) -> ACK (Receiver)

Address Classes IPv4
- Class A (unicast)
- Class B (unicast)
- Class C (unicast)
- Class D - multicast (one device talking to a group of device, rather than 1 to 1)
- Class E - reserved for future or experimental purposes
* classful addresses superseeded by CIDR (classless interdomain routing) in 1993
* allocated by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

Class A (start with binary 1 - 1XXXXXXX)
- first 8 bits = network
- Start with 1, end with 126  1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255
- 0 is reserved for default network, and 127 is reserved for loopback
- [00000000 network],[00000000,00000000,00000000 hosts]

Class B (start with binary 10 - 10XXXXXX)
- first 16 bits = network
- Start with 128, end with 192 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
- [00000000, 00000000 network],[00000000,00000000 hosts]

Class C (start with binary 110 -> 110XXXXX)
- first 24 bits = network
- Start with 192, end with 223 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
- [00000000, 00000000,00000000 network],[00000000 hosts]

Class D - multicast 
- 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255

Class E - reserved for future or experimental purposes
- 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255

Directed Broadcast Address
- Host sends data to all devices on a specific network
- It is when all host bits at set to 1s
ex. network 172.31.0.0 => broadcast 172.31.255.255
- Routers can route directed broadcast, but it is disabled by default to prevent hacking utilities (ex. Smurf) performing DoS attacks

Local Broadcast Address
- communicate with all devices on local network
- address is all binary 1s 255.255.255.255
ex. host requests an IP address from DHCP server Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- local broadcast address is ALWAYS dropped by router, however this can be bypassed with DHCP forwarding or DHCP relay
ex. device B (vlan 10) connects through a router A to the DHCP server (vlan20) through a router. However, it broadcasts out DHCP request, but blocked by router A. When DHCP forwrading or relay is turned on, then router A blocks this broadcast request, but proxies a unicast DHCP request to the DHCP server on behalf of device B

Local loopback address
- 127.0.0.1 -> system send a message to itself (anything in range 127.X.X.X is loopback, anyone can be used to test this TCP/IP stack is correctly installed on a machine)
- Notice 127.0.0.1 is class A, therefore design flaw of IPv4 to use this class A address for this purpose, loses 16 million addresses
- IPv6 uses "::1"
*Routers and Switches loopback address ("loopback interface") is different than Local loopback address

Private Addresses
- Request for Comments is a formal document (Internet Engineering Task Force IETF drafted by a community from multiple vendors), changes can be made only by another RFC - it can be superseeded
- Internet Standards
- RFC1918: private IP addresses are non routable addresses on the internet, blocked by ISP
Blocked by IANA Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
	-> 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255
	-> 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255
	-> 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255
- RFC3927: IPv4 Link-Local Addresses, Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA) by Microsoft. Range 169.254.0.0 /16. Allows devices through a cable or local segment (switch) to communicate to each other when no DHCP server is available without configuration. Host would randomly generate the host specific part of the address

Subnet Mask
- Local vs Remote
-> if the network portion of the device A is the same as device B, then A and B are on the same network - hence, local - otherwise the A is remote to B

Discontiguous Subnet Mask
- Subnet mask must start with Binary 1s and afterwards 0s have to be together ex 255.240.0.0 = 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000
- Discontiguous subnet mask is inconsistent, ex. 240.255.3.191 = 11110000.11111111.00000110.11000000
*Discontiguous subnet mask is not supported by Cisco devices

CIDR (Classless InterDomain Routing - introduced in 1993)
- Replaced classful IP addressing
- Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)
ex. CIDR notation = /24 instead of 255.255.255.0 or /11 = 255.224.0.0 (not on Octet)

Subnetting
ex. 172.16.35.123 /20 
== 172.16.01000011.123 255.255.240.0
Therefore 35 -> 0100 0011
0100 = network = 32
0011 = host = 3
*Network IP = 172.16.32.0 [all host = 0]
*1st IP = 172.16.32.1 [all host = 0, except for last = 1]
*Last IP = 172.16.47.254 [all host = 1, except for last = 0]
*Broadcast = 172.16.47.255 [all host = 1]

Subnetting
ex. 172.16.129.1 /17
== 172.16.10000001.1 255.255.128.0
Therefore 129 -> 1 000 0001
1 = network = 128
000 0001 = host = 1
*Network IP = 172.16.128.0 [all host = 0]
*1st IP = 172.16.128.1 [all host = 0, except for last = 1]
*Last IP = 172.16.255.254 [all host = 1, except for last = 0]
*Broadcast = 172.16.255.255 [all host = 1]

Subnetting and Networks
# of host of subnet = 2^n - 2 (network and broadcast)
# of networks = 2^n
ex. 10.1.1.0 /24 into subnets that support 14 machines
1) 2^4-2 = 16 - 2 = 14 machines. Therefore, we need a subnet of /28 (borrowing 4 bits)
2) Turn /24 into /28, 10.1.1.0 -> 10.1.1. 0000 | 0000
So... 
10.1.1.0 /28 (0000 | 0000)
10.1.1.16 /28 (0001 | 0000)
10.1.1.32 /28 (0010 | 0000)
10.1.1.48 /28 (0011 | 0000)
...
10.1.1.240 /28 (not 254 because 255.255.255.240 = /28 or 1111|0000 - remember .240 because host portion remains 0))

Subnetting and Networks
ex. 10.128.192.0 /18 requires 30 subnets as many hosts as possible
# of networks (subnets) = 2^5, therefore n=5 (borrow 5 bits)
/18 = 255.255.192.0
192 -> 11 | 000000
We need to borrow 5 bits, therefore /18 -> /23 and 11|000000 becomes 1100000|0
So...
10.128.192.0 /23 (1100000|0)
10.128.194.0 /23 (1100001|0)
10.128.196.0 /23 (1100010|0)
10.128.198.0 /23 (1100011|0)
...
10.128.254.0 /23 (1111111|0 - remember 254.0 because host portion remains 0)

ex. What is the network address for 172.16.1.1 with network mask 255.255.192.0?
network mask = 255.255.192.0 = /18 or 11 | 000000 (host)
-> Make all host = 0 to find network address, therefore 172.16.0.0 /18

ex. What is the broadcast address for host 172.16.1.1 with network mask 255.255.192.0?
network mask 255.255.192.0 = /18 or 11 | 000000. 00000000 (host)
-> Make all host = 1 to find broadcast address, therefore 172.16.63.255 /18

ex. PC's ip address is 192.168.1.130/27, configure the router's Ethernet 0 interface with the last IP address in the same subnet
-> /27 = 255.255.255.224 or 100 | 00010
-> Therefore, last ip address = broadcast - 1
-> Set hosts = 1, 100 | 11111 = 159, 159 - 1 = 158 
-> Therefore, router's Ethernet 0 interface should be 192.168.1.158 /27

ex. Subnet 192.168.1.128 /26 to allow it to host only 2 hosts
1) To host 2 hosts, we only require 2 host bits. Therefore 255.255.255.252 or /30 or 10 (network) | 00 00 (new subnet) | 00 (new host)
2) # of new subnets with 2 host bits is 2^(network bits borrowed) = 2^4 = 16 new subnets
Therefore new subnets would be:
192.168.1.128 /30 (10 (network) | 00 00 (new subnet) | 00 (new host))
192.168.1.132 /30 (10 (network) | 00 01 (new subnet) | 00 (new host))
192.168.1.136 /30 (10 (network) | 00 10 (new subnet) | 00 (new host))
... /30
192.168.1.188 /30 (10 (network) | 11 11 (new subnet) | 00 (new host))

Basic Communication:
- CSMA/CD Carrier Sense Multiple Access Colision Detection
- Broadcast is not supported on IPv6
- Broadcast vs Multicast - multicast is a selected group of broadcast

Bus Topology (early ethernet)
- Connects through a T connector
- 10base5 "thicknet" (500meters distance)
- 10base2 "thinnet" (185meters distance)
- Uses CSMA/CD to avoid Collision
-> CS Carrier Sense checks the wire 
-> MA Multiple Access allows multiple devices to access one wire

10base2
- AKA "Single Collision Domain / Single Broadcast Domain
- Coax cable
- baseband
- 10mbs is the maximum speed
- 2 is the maximum segment length of 185meters
- Base = baseband - single signal in the wire (whereas broadband allows for multiple signal in the wire)
- Ends with a Terminator, because again... single signal. Therefore if it heads back, collision would occur
(ISSUE1) Collision
(ISSUE2) Cable Length, longer the cable, greater the degradation
(ISSUE3) Cable break -> No terminator
(ISSUE4) 10Mbps is for the entire segment, not per device. Because of Collisions, you can only utilize 30-40% of the speed
ex. 10Mbps through 4 devices, 10/4 = 2.5, then *0.3 = 0.75Mbps

10baseT
- Shielded/Unshielded twisted pair
- maximum segment length of 100meters
- Base = baseband

RJ45 Pin Connector
- T568A or T568B 
- TIA EIA 568 defined as structured cabling standards
- EIA stands for Electronics Industry Alliance
- T568A (s.green, green, s.orange, blue, s.blue, orange, s.brown, brown)
- T568B (s.orange, orange, s.green, blue, s.blue, green, s.brown, brown) is most popular 

Straight Through Cables
- When connecting PC to Router/Switch, etc
- Uses Straight Through Cables (pin 1, corresponds to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2 etc...)
- Ethernet port interface used on NICs, routers and uplink ports

Cross Over Cable
- When connecting 2 PCs or 2 Routers together
- TX transmit
- RX receive
- Pins cross (pin 1 TX+ to pin 3 RX+, pin 2 TX- to pin 6 RX-, pin 3 RX+ to pin 1 TX+, pin 6 RX- to pin 2 TX-)
-> in 10baseT or 100baseT, pin 4 5 7 8 are not used
-> in gigabit, all pins are used

Cable Category
- Cat3: telephone wiring, used to be used for data transfer
- Cat5: frequency up to 100MHz, speeds of 10/100 Mbps supported up to 100meters
- Cat5e: frequency up to 100Mhz, supports 1Gbps (improve Cat5 by reducing noise and interference... most Cat5 meets Cat5e specs, but might not meet certifications therefore, not categorized as Cat5e) up to 100meters
- Cat6: frequency up to 250Mhz, increase pair twists per inch, supports 10Gbps. up to 55meters. Suitable for 10baseT, 100baseTx or fastEthernet or 1000baseTe or Gigabitethernet or 10GbpEthernet
- Cat6a (argumented): frequency up to 500Mhz, supports 10Gbps. up to 100meters.
- Cat7 - frequency up to 600Mhz, supports 10Gbps. up to 100meters ( can be tera Connectors, doesnt have to be RJ45). Foiled every pair - class F
- Cat7a - frequency up to 1000Mhz, supports 100Gbps.
- Cat8 - supports 40Gbps
- Cat8.1 - backward compatible and interoperable with Cat6a
- Cat8.2 - interoperable with Cat7

When to use Straight Through and Cross Over?
- Straight Through: router-switch, pc-switch, pc-bridge, pc-hub
- Cross Over: switch-switch, pc-pc, hub-hub, router-router, bridge-switch, pc-server, hub-switch

MDI Media Dependent Interface
- Nowadys Auto MDI/MDIX made cross over cables obsolete - auto detect cable type
- PC, routers uses MDI
- Switches and Hub uses MDIX


Hub vs Bridge vs Switch

MAC Address
- 48 bits (24 bits to OUI + 24 bits to Station Address)
- OUI = Organizational Identifier - identifies vendor
- Station address should be unique (can be changed in software) but it is burnt into NIC physically

MAC OUI 
- Last bit in the 1st Octet is 0 (unicast) or 1 (multicast)
- 2nd last bit in the 1st Octet is 0 (globally unique MAC address) or 1 (administrator has changed this in software)
